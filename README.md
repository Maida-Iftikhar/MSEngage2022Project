# MSEngage2022Project
* Introduction‚≠ê
* This is a facial recognition based attendance system. It is majorly coded in Python, OpenCv. It works by recognising the faces and storing them into a .csv file. 
The real time of attendance is recorded as well, making it an efficient alternataive for regular attendances in the schools , offices or other institues. 
For this project,
I have created a folder named ImagesAttendance which stores the data of the attendees. I have stored the images of Elon Musk, Jack Ma, Mark Zuckerberg, JK Rowling 
and a picture of my little cousin Anam Fatima who was too fascinated to be recognised by a computer.
The file named "Requirements.txt" contains all the tech used and their respective versions too.
The main dependencies used are:
* Flask
* OpenCV
* Facial_recognition
* Facial_recognition_models (Which is internally used by facial_recognition)
* Dlib (Internally used by facial_recognition
*For ipackaging the app *GUI based version of pyinstaller (Known as auto-py-to-exe) Or simply pyinstaller was used 

* Instructions to run it:
1. Here's the Google drive link. "[Click Here]"  "(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VIRzIYNrVgvmRkPKOzIUIo_SdMXIi6-r?usp=sharing)"
2. Then click download all. It will download a zip
3. Extract it and you will see a folder app inside extracted folder.In that app folder you will find app.exe file
4. Run it
5. Wait for the output text in the app console And then in the console it will show you to open localhost:5000/




**Note: You always requested to execute the app.exe inside the app folder only because all the dependencies of that app.exe are in that folder. So no shortcuts
would work.
