# MSEngage2022Project
*Introduction‚≠ê
* This is a facial recognition based attendance system. It is majorly coded in Python, OpenCvIt works by recognising the faces and storing them into a .csv file. 
The real time of attendance is recorded as well, making it an efficient alternataive for regular attendances in the schools , offices or other institues. 
For this project,
I have created a folder named ImagesAttendance which stores the data of the attendees. I have stored the images of Elon Musk, Jack Ma, Mark Zuckerberg, JK Rowling 
and a picture of my little cousin Anam Fatima who was too fascinated to be recognised by a computer.
The file named "Requirements.txt" contains all the tech used and their respective versions too.
The main dependencies used are:
**Flask
*OpenCV
*facial_recognition
*facial_recognition_models (Which is internally used by facial_recognition)
*dlib (Internally used by facial_recognition
* For integrating my work into into a webpage format *GUI based version of pyinstaller (Known as auto-py-to-exe) Or simply pyinstaller
* was used 


**Note: You always requested to execute the app.exe inside the app folder only because all the dependencies of that app.exe are in that folder. So no shortcuts
would work.
